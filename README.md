# Nessie Sim 2014

## What?

Play as a lurking lake monster and snatch tourists and photographers from their waterside relaxation.
Just don't get your picture in the local papers!
Download it from [itch.io](http://eightyeight.itch.io/nessie-sim-2014).

Made for [Monster Mash 2014](http://itch.io/jam/monster-mash).

## Why?

It sounded like a good idea at the time.

## How?

Use WASD to move, Space to attack when you're near somebody, Ctrl to make some bubbles and scare them, and Shift to swim more slowly.
If you have a controller plugged in, you should be able to move with the left stick, attack with A, bubble with B, and swim slowly by leaning lightly on the stick.

At any time you can hit Escape to do just that.

## Install instructions

Works on Windows only, unfortunately.
Ubuntu and OSX binaries may be provided in the future.
Just run **NessieSim14.exe** to play.
To turn on shadows and nicer water, edit **prefs.cs**.
